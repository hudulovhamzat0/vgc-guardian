‚ú® Features
Continuous Monitoring: Automatically checks if the VGC service is running in the background.

Auto-Restart: If the VGC service crashes or stops, the guardian will attempt to restart it.

Intuitive GUI: A clean and user-friendly interface with multiple stylish themes to personalize your experience.

Manual Controls: Easily start, stop, restart, or check the VGC service status with dedicated buttons.

Activity Log: A detailed log with timestamps helps you track all actions and troubleshoot issues.

Administrator Warning: Detects if the application is not running with administrator rights and provides a clear warning, as admin privileges are required for service control.

üìã Requirements
Operating System: Windows 10/11 (Service control commands are Windows-specific).

Python: Version 3.6 or higher.

Python Packages:

psutil: For process and system utility monitoring.

tkinter: The standard Python GUI library (usually included with Python installations).

Administrator Privileges: The application must be run as an Administrator to successfully start, stop, or restart Windows services.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Usage
1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/hudulovhamzat0/vgc-guardian.git
cd vgc-guardian

2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

pip install psutil

(Note: tkinter is typically included with Python, and pyinstaller is only needed if you plan to build an executable.)

3. Run the Application
Execute the main.py script:

python main.py

Important: For full functionality (especially service control), right-click on main.py and select "Run as Administrator," or run your terminal as Administrator before executing the command.

Building an Executable (Optional)
If you want to create a standalone executable (.exe) file for easier distribution, you'll need PyInstaller.

Install PyInstaller:

pip install pyinstaller

Build the Executable:
Navigate to the project root directory in your command prompt and run:

python -m pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico --uac-admin main.py

--onefile: Creates a single executable file.

--windowed: Prevents a console window from appearing when the app runs.

--icon=icon.ico: Sets the application icon (ensure icon.ico is in the same directory or provide its full path).

--uac-admin: Prompts for Administrator privileges when the executable is run.

The executable will be generated in the dist folder.
